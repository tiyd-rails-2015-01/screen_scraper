# Scholar Search!

This program returns ten article titles from any scholar of your choosing.

### How to Use This Amazing Program

* Type "ruby scholar_scraper.rb" into your terminal window.
* You will be asked for the name of a scholar.
* Once you write a name and hit Enter, you will receive your results.

### Optional Steps:

These steps are for those interested in a little history. Follow them if you would like to learn about how people found information in Old-Timey days, such as the Wild West, Ancient Egypt, or the '80s.

* Write down the name of the articles you would like to read on a piece of paper (pronounced PAY-per).
* Go to your local library.
* Search for the physical articles within the Reference section.
  * Sometimes these will be on microfilm format.
* Feel the weight of physical information, the way the paper cuts your fingers, the frustration of turning a page and turning two.
* Leave the library. It is a silly place.
