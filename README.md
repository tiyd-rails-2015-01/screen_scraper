# Google Scholar Screen Scraper

## Description

The Google Scholar Screen Scraper is used to grab information from the Google Scholar website and 'scrapes' it on your Command Line. All you need to do is type in an author and the Scholar Scraper will return to you the articles that the author has written. It will also return a bibliography so you can cite the work in your own articles or research papers.

## How does it work?

Our program uses two Gems that pull down information from an HTML website and convert it into a string. Then the magic of Ruby takes over. We wrote a set of instructions that effectively pulls our certain types of data from the HTML code. Our code extracts data via HTML classes and sorts it to give you the useful information that you need.

If you are a developer looking to brush up on your skill set, this is a great exercise to teach you the following things:

  * Parse a tag-based document.
  * Build tests to cover an existing codebase.
  * Fix bugs in an out-of-date codebase.
  * Refactor an existing non-object-oriented codebase to become object-oriented.
  * Add features to an existing codebase using Test-Driven Development.
  * Develop simple applications while pair programming.
